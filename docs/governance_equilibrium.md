# Governance Feedback Framework

### Overview
The Governance Feedback Framework defines how domains maintain dynamic equilibrium
between limiting agency and preserving free will.

### Control Equation
dS/dt = k1(P - L) - k2(E - W)


| Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| **S** | Societal stability |
| **P** | Presence energy (Numen output) |
| **L** | Lima damping (bureaucratic inertia) |
| **E** | External limitation (law density) |
| **W** | Free-will preservation index |

Equilibrium occurs when `dS/dt = 0`.

## Feedback Loop Components
- **Sensors:** civic participation, trust metrics, creativity indices  
- **Actuators:** policy modulation, education investment, transparency initiatives  
- **Controller:** adaptive feedback node maintaining bounded oscillation around equilibrium  

The system acts like a PID controller:
- *Proportional:* responds to the size of imbalance.  
- *Integral:* corrects long-term bias.  
- *Derivative:* anticipates and dampens spikes.

## Judicial Function
Judges operate at the **derivative term** `k_d (dS/dt)`,
interpreting edge cases where the equation fails to predict behavior.
Their rulings convert tension into learning, keeping the civic orbit stable.

## Design Principle
> The stateâ€™s first duty is not to command, but to keep freedom habitable.  
> It must never protect order at the cost of will, nor will at the cost of shared reality.

## Implementation Notes
- The equilibrium loop is diagnostic, not prescriptive.  
- Data sources must remain transparent and consent-based.  
- Corrective actions favor education, dialogue, and structural repair over punishment.
