# Hypothesis H-1 (Revised)

**Statement:**  
Humanity is sloppy â€” and need not remain so.  
Sloppiness marks the initial state of moral and cognitive evolution; the task is to find the road from chaos to coherence without erasing freedom.

**Notes:**  
- Treated as a working principle for modeling human variability and adaptability.  
- Empirically consistent; treated as fact in daily operation, but retained as an open variable for modeling adaptability.  
- Provides the baseline entropy term in the Governance Feedback Framework.  
- Implies that perfection is neither attainable nor desirable; the goal is sustainable coherence.
