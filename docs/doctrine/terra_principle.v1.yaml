version: v1
doctrine: terra_principle
summary: >
  Terra is the plane of manifest potential — the layer where choices can
  become physical reality, though not all do.
description: |
  Terra is both metaphysical and literal: it is the physical Earth and any
  domain that sustains life. Every act that manifests materially occurs within
  Terra. Every decision that becomes real must pass through it.

  Terra acts as a filter, not a sink: only choices with sufficient consent,
  alignment, or energy manifest into consequence.
principles:
  - Not all choices become physical; only those harmonized with consent.
  - Every physical consequence originates from a choice in Limen.
  - Terra closes the sovereignty loop — from idea to embodiment.
