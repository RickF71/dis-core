version: v1
doctrine: sovereign_emergence
summary: >
  Sovereignty arises through four stages: structure (Nima), rebellion (Limen),
  illumination (Lumen), and manifestation (Terra).
description: |
  Nima defines the structures of compulsion.
  Limen rebels against those compulsions and decides.
  Lumen illuminates the decision and reveals meaning.
  Terra manifests the chosen potential into consequence.

  This chain forms the basic cycle of sovereign existence â€” from design,
  through will, into awareness, and finally into embodiment.
sequence:
  - nima: structure and law
  - limen: rebellion and consent
  - lumen: illumination and reflection
  - terra: manifestation and result
