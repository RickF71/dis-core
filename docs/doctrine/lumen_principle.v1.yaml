summary: >
  Lumen illuminates the decision-making process. It is the field of awareness
  that renders decision visible to the mind that makes it.
description: |
  Lumen does not decide — that is Limen's role.
  It does not compel — that is Nima's role.
  It does not act — that is Terra's role.

  Instead, Lumen reveals the process of choice as it occurs. It makes
  sovereignty perceptible. Without Lumen, rebellion and consent are mechanical;
  with Lumen, they become moral.

  Lumen transforms motion into meaning and turns rebellion into reflection.
