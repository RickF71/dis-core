  The ability to rebel against the compulsion of Numen is the beginning of Lima.
description: |
  This principle marks the birth of sovereignty — the first moment when a being
  may choose otherwise. Numen compulsion represents inevitability; Lima (later
  Limen) begins when that inevitability is questioned.

  Rebellion against inevitability is not chaos — it is the spark of moral
  agency. Consent originates here: not from obedience, but from the power
  to refuse.
