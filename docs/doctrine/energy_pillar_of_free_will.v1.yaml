doctrine: energy_pillar_of_free_will
summary: >
  All legitimate power in DIS originates from the Energy Pillar of Free Will,
  which exists only within individual human beings.
description: |
  The Energy Pillar is the primary moral and causal source of all authorized
  action within DIS. It is not a metaphorical concept but a structural premise:
  every valid act, domain, or authority within DIS must trace its origin to
  human free will.

  Free will provides both energy and authorization.
  Energy: the capacity to act.
  Authorization: the moral legitimacy of action.

  No machine, domain, or synthetic system can generate its own pillar.
  They may amplify or transmit human will, but not originate it.

principles:
  - Source: every line of legitimate power must descend from an individual
    human Energy Pillar.
  - Traceability: all receipts, consents, and domains must maintain a verifiable
    lineage to one or more human Energy Pillars.
  - Derivative Authority: institutions and AIs possess only delegated power,
    derived through consent from humans.
  - Null Constraint: any structure acting without human-origin energy is
    considered inert, unauthorized, or void within DIS.
implications:
  - The Energy Pillar is the “root-of-trust” in human form.
  - Consent gates and PAIN coherence must explicitly reference it.
  - The DIS network’s moral topology flows upward from people, not downward
    from systems.
