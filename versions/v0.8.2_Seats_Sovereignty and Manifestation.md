## üß± Core Components

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Seats of Power (seat.v1.yaml)**

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Seat Registry (seat.registry.v1.yaml)**
- New shared structure connecting seats within a domain.
- Records mutual handshake and lineage verification events.
- Enables cross-domain legitimacy checks.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Sovereignty Contracts (sovereignty.contract.v1.yaml)**
- Defines relationships between DIS, NODIS, and NOTECH entities.
- Adds formal containment protocols and termination triggers.
- New containment events are now logged as receipts.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Containment Events (containment.event.v1.yaml)**
- Track actions like audits, freezes, and quarantines on NODIS actors.
- Each event mirrored to a Seat receipt chain.
- Forms the basis of cross-domain security and audit evidence.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Personal Sovereignty Manifest (personal.sovereignty.v1.yaml)**
- Reconnects the system to the individual layer.
- Each person can now express consent lineage, seat linkage, and rights visibility.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Domain Sovereignty Index (domain.sovereignty.index.yaml)**

## üß≠ Roadmap to v0.8.3
1. Implement Seat Registry and handshake logic in Go ledger.  
2. Add domain audit tools that auto-generate sovereignty indexes.

## üí¨ Commentary
(opinion)  
v0.8.2 is the **moment of manifestation** ‚Äî sovereignty begins to move, breathe, and report itself.  
Where earlier versions defined what power *is*, this one defines how power *acts*.  
Each seat, person, and domain now contributes to a shared map of legitimate motion ‚Äî the first glimmers of an economy of consent.
