dis_jikka:
  version: v0.1
  description: >
    Defines the conditions under which a Jikka field may form between domains.
    Jikka represents a moral resonanceâ€”an emergent field of shared awareness
    arising only when free will recognizes free will. It cannot be automated,
    simulated, or coerced.

  fields:
    jikka_id:
      type: string
      description: Unique identifier for this Jikka field instance.

    domain_a:
      type: string
      description: Reference to the initiating domain.
    
    domain_b:
      type: string
      description: Reference to the responding domain.

    free_will_a:
      type: boolean
      description: Whether domain_a possesses and expresses free will.

    free_will_b:
      type: boolean
      description: Whether domain_b possesses and expresses free will.

    recognition:
      type: boolean
      description: True only if both domains acknowledge the other's moral presence.

    consent:
      type: boolean
      description: True only if both domains freely choose to engage.

    reflection:
      type: boolean
      description: True only if both domains maintain self-awareness in engagement.

    field_strength:
      type: number
      range: [0.0, 1.0]
      description: >
        Represents the coherence of mutual awareness.
        0.0 = no resonance; 1.0 = complete harmonic awareness.
        This is not moral correctness, but relational coherence.

    integrity:
      type: enum
      values: [absent, latent, active, transcendent]
