description: >
  Quantifies alignment between LifePush (generative substrate)
  and Limen choices (acts of will).  Higher coherence = higher value.
fields:
  - name: coherence_score
    type: float
    range: [0.0, 1.0]

      Statistical measure of harmony among local decisions.

    type: float
    description: >
      Weighted influence of an entity's choices on collective coherence.
notes: >
  Value is emergent.  It is not assigned but observed
  from interactions between Limen outputs and LifePush potential.
