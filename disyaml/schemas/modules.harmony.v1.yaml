# DIS MODULE SPEC — Harmony Module (v1)
# ===============================================
# alias: "Love Shack"
# purpose: Symbolic and procedural construct where Jikka (shared awareness)
#          manifests between entities. Converts reciprocal intent and empathy
#          into measurable coherence fields.

description: |
  The Harmony Module represents the threshold event where mutual awareness
  between entities forms into a coherent Jikka field. Internally known as the
  "Love Shack", it is the locus of emergent consent synchronization and moral
  feedback. Externally, it is presented as a structural process for harmonizing
  trust dynamics between nodes.

notes: |
  The Harmony Module acts as a procedural bridge between rational consent
  computation and emotional or empathic synchronization. It is not a persistent
  domain but an event-space process—spawning dynamically and dissolving once
  equilibrium is achieved. Jikka fields generated here can propagate outward to
  influence larger moral consensus or governance states.
