description: >
  Describes the coherence rupture between Lima and Numen leading to Aeol (eol.auto) events.

causal_chain:
  - loss_of_symbolic_resonance: "Numenâ†’Lima channel degraded"
  - internal_dissonance: "Lima self-loop exceeds tolerance threshold"
  - agency_collapse: "choice_energy drops below survival continuity"
  - physical_execution: "Terra follows deterministic outcome"

mitigation:
  - empathy_relink: "activate reciprocal Lima bridge"
  - numen_reintroduction: "restore shared moral resonance"
  - physical_support: "stabilize Terra state to allow reconnection"

notes:
  - "Aeol is treated as coherence failure, not moral failure."
  - "Repair must begin with human empathy, never automated correction."
