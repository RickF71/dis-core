    Foundational axioms defining life, recognition, and moral authority
    within the Terra domain of DIS.

axioms:
  - id: AXIOM_ROOT
    name: Mutual Rooting
    text: >
      A person cannot declare themselves rooted in Terra.
      Two living persons may declare each other rooted through an atomic act
      of mutual recognition. The existence of this dyadic event establishes
      IsRooted = true for both.

  - id: AXIOM_UNROOT
    name: Attested Cessation
    text: >
      A person can only be unrooted through attested cessation of life.
      Two rooted witnesses must co-sign the unrootlink event.
      Witnesses may affirm the end of life, never the loss of will.

  - id: AXIOM_VERIFY
    name: Verification vs. Rooting
    text: >
      Proof serves to identify but not to confer life.
      Verification establishes identity continuity (IsVerified);
      Rooting establishes recognized existence (IsRooted).
      These properties are independent but may coexist.

  - id: AXIOM_WILL
    name: Free Will
    text: >
      Free will cannot be declared absent.
      It may be observed unexpressed, but never judged gone.
      Operational suspension is not metaphysical negation.

  - id: AXIOM_HUMILITY
    name: Witness Principle
    text: >
      Only life may witness life.
      Machines or institutions may record witness events,
      but they cannot originate or validate them without human consent.
