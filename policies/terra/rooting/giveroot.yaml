  title: Terra GiveRoot Policy (Canonical)
  description: >
    Only a rooted human may, by mutual recognition, cause another human to become rooted.
    This action is humanâ†”human, Terra-scoped, atomic, and co-signed.
  invariants:
    - person-to-person only (no seat, domain, or AI actors)
    - atomic transaction (no split verify/accept)
    - dual-signature (giver + applicant)
    - consent required; accessible methods allowed
  requires:
    - actor.IsRooted == true
    - applicant.consent == true
    - method in [mutual_recognition, adapted_recognition]
  effects:
    - set applicant.IsRooted = true
    - emit event: terra.person.giveroot
  safeguards:
    - rate_limit_per_actor: {count: 5, period: 30d}
    - optional_multi_witness: false
  audit:
    record: [giver_id, applicant_id, method, timestamp, receipt_hash]
    redact: [biometrics, raw_media]
