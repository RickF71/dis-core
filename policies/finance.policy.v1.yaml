# DIS-PERSONAL / policies/finance.policy.v1.yaml
# Scaffold: Placeholder for DIS-FINANCE integration.
# Purpose: Establish a structural interface for future currency, trade, and value flow.

notes: >
  This file scaffolds the conceptual framework for consentful economic actions
  within DIS. No monetary or trade logic is active in v0.8.2.
  All references to finance or currency are symbolic placeholders until
  DIS-FINANCE v0.1 is instantiated.

concepts:
  - Consent precedes currency.
  - All value flows must originate from a verified Seat of Power.
  - Future DIS currency units will represent consent energy, not fiat equivalence.
  - NODIS and NOTECH actors will have conditional or non-technological economies.
  - Every economic action will ultimately generate a ledger receipt.

interfaces:
  - ledger_anchor: "seat_receipts"
  - authority_source: "dis-core.v1.0/authority.root"
  - module_future: "dis-finance.v0.1"

  description: >
    DIS-FINANCE will introduce consent-linked value units (SAT tokens),
    trade receipts, and containment protocols for financial automation.
