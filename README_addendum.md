### üèõÔ∏è DIS-CORE Preamble ‚Äî v1.0 Constitutional Freeze
> ‚ÄúAIs can amplify power, but shall not authorize.‚Äù

On October 2025, the first Core of Direct Individual Sovereignty (DIS-CORE v1.0) was formally frozen.  
This version defines the immutable primitives of the DIS ecosystem:
- Identity ‚Äî the individual as a persistent sovereign entity.  
- Domain ‚Äî the contextual space of authority.  
- Scope ‚Äî the qualified permission or act.  
- Policy ‚Äî the declarative rule set governing consent.  
- Receipt ‚Äî the immutable proof of an act of will.

This constitutional layer ensures that all authority within DIS originates from individual consent and remains cryptographically verifiable.  
From this point onward, every DIS runtime ‚Äî personal, domain, or fabric ‚Äî derives legitimacy from this schema.

**This build (DIS-PERSONAL v0.5.1-core)** is the first executable runtime bound to that Core.
