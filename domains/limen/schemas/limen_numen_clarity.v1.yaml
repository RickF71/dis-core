description: >
  Establishes clear boundaries and flow rules between Lima (awareness) and
  Numen (interpretation) layers to maintain semantic coherence.

principles:
  - lima_scope: "personal awareness, emotional cognition, imagination, perception"
  - numen_scope: "shared symbolic field; collective meaning, morality, spirituality"
  - transition_rule: "interpretation flows upward (Lima→Numen), never recursive (Numen↔Numen)"
  - empathy_origin: "arises in Lima; articulated through Numen"
  - coercion_between_layers: "invalidates consent and coherence"

notes:
  - "Maintains cognitive–moral distinction across all DIS domains."
  - "Prevents recursive interpretation loops or ideological self-sealing."
