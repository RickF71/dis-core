  description: >
    Foundational statement defining the relationship between DIS
    (the fabric of sovereignty) and the domains that participate within it.

axioms:
  - id: AXIOM_DOMAIN_OBLIGATION
    name: Domain Obligation to DIS
    text: >
      DIS may not govern individuals, but it governs domains.
      Every domain that wishes to participate within DIS must
      accept its foundational axioms and remain accountable to
      the network fabric that safeguards individual sovereignty.
      Specific obligations and enforcement mechanisms shall be
      defined by policy at a later stage.

  - id: AXIOM_LIFE_MAXIMAL
    name: Life as Maximal
    text: >
      Terra holds that all life is maximal.
      This axiom establishes the upper bound of moral worth:
      no life may be valued less than life itself.
      Interpretation and application remain open to future understanding.


notes:
  - "Power must have mirrors; domains are the mirrors through which DIS ensures human sovereignty."
