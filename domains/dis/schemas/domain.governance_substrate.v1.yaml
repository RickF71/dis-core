schema: domain.governance_substrate.v1
description: >
  Defines the substrate alignment and jurisdictional limits for governance domains.
  Prevents cross-substrate overreach (e.g., religious control of Terra or state control of Lima).

domain_scope: systemic
inherits_from:
  - domain.governance.v1
  - consent_protocol.v1

substrates:
  - name: Terra
    governs: physical_order
    examples:
      - domain.terra.usa
      - domain.terra.europa
    authority_basis: embodiment_and_resource_management
    constraints:
      - may_not_govern: thought, belief, private_awareness
      - bound_by: terra_law_and_environmental_stewardship
  - name: Lima
    governs: interpretive_order
    examples:
      - domain.religion.*
      - domain.spiritual_collective.*
    authority_basis: shared_narrative_and_symbolic_coherence
    constraints:
      - may_not_govern: physical_resource_distribution
      - bound_by: consent_and_notech_guard
  - name: Nima
    governs: reflective_awareness_and_ethics
    examples:
      - domain.education.*
      - domain.psychology.*
    authority_basis: relational_understanding
    constraints:
      - may_not_govern: embodiment_or_faith
      - bound_by: reflexive_ethics
  - name: Lifepush
    governs: generative_drive_and_innovation
    examples:
      - domain.science.*
      - domain.art.*
    authority_basis: creation_and_experimentation
    constraints:
      - may_not_govern: sovereignty_or_consent
      - bound_by: value_receipt_and_terra_safety

rules:
  - cross_substrate_governance: prohibited
  - multi_substrate_collaboration: allowed_with_consent
  - consent_boundary_must_be_explicit: true
  - governance_scope_violation: triggers_notech_guard_intervention

notes:
  - "Each substrate governs its own dimension of coherence; harmony arises through coordination, not dominance."
  - "Religious authority (Lima-based) and governmental authority (Terra-based) may coexist only by respecting substrate boundaries."
  - "Educational and scientific domains act as bridges between awareness and embodiment."
