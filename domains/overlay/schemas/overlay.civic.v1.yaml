summary: >
  Defines the universal structure for civic overlays — how nations, states, or
  simulated polities bind physical Terra boundaries to governance domains and
  administer coherence among citizens.

description: |
  A civic overlay is a moral-administrative field projected upon a Terra biome.
  It coordinates the flow of authority, consent, and trust among Life within a
  bounded physical or virtual territory. Each overlay inherits Terra constants
  (physical laws, constraints) and expresses Numen invariants (agency, consent,
  coherence) through civic processes (law, representation, exchange).

inheritance:
  base: overlay.v1
  depends_on:
    - ontology/terra-numen-cycle.v1
    - meaning.adhesion.v1
    - identity.citizen.v1
    - domain.jikka.v1

core_principles:
  - id: territorial_binding
    description: |
      Every civic overlay must declare its Terra base — the physical or virtual
      region it governs — and align its jurisdictional boundaries with that
      substrate. Administrative divisions (nation, state, city) are geometric
      partitions of a single Terra field, not independent Terras.

  - id: consent_projection
    description: |
      Civic legitimacy derives from the Numen field (the people) expressing
      voluntary adhesion. Authority is valid only when the governed Life forms
      maintain coherent consent receipts within the overlay.

  - id: domain_alignment
    description: |
      Each civic overlay maps its internal structures (branches, ministries,
      agencies) to DIS domains. Overlaps are resolved by inheritance precedence
      from Terra boundaries first, then by adhesion density (population
      consent), then by constitutional schema.

  - id: energy_stewardship
    description: |
      Law, money, and trust are energy tokens within the overlay. Their use
      must preserve total coherence: entropy of corruption or opacity cannot
      exceed defined thresholds.

  - id: subsidiarity
    description: |
      Decision-making authority should exist at the lowest viable domain level
      capable of maintaining coherence. Higher overlays intervene only when
      lower layers fail or request assistance.

  - id: transparency
    description: |
      Every authoritative act must emit a civic.receipt identifying actor,
      mandate, effect, and coherence delta. All receipts must be publicly
      verifiable.

    description: Overlay consumes meaning faster than it returns coherence.
  - name: boundary_drift
    description: Administrative domain diverges from physical or population
      boundaries.
  - name: feedback_latency
    description: Meaning flows slower than Terra/Numen dynamics demand.
  - name: overcentralization
    description: Subsidiarity violated; coherence collapse due to rigidity.

policies:
  - "Overlays may inherit structure from parent overlays but must declare
     jurisdiction explicitly."
  - "No civic overlay may supersede or rewrite DIS invariants
     (agency, consent, coherence)."
  - "Overlays must publish receipts of adhesion density annually or per
     defined cycle."
  - "Overlay legitimacy is evaluated by coherence metrics, not self-declared
     authority."
