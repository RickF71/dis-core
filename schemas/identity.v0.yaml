type: identity.v0
description: >
  The core DIS identity schema.
  Each record represents a recognized individual, agent, or domain anchor.
  Identity is defined by consent, not authority. The namespace field
  provides a human-readable alias or context link, which may later
  be cryptographically bound to the dis_uid.

version: 0.1
domain: domain.terra
category: core-identity

fields:
  - name: dis_uid
    type: string
    required: true
    unique: true
    description: >
      The universal DIS identifier for the individual or entity.
      Form: dis_uid:<domain>:<namespace>:<hash>.

  - name: namespace
    type: string
    required: false
    description: >
      A human-readable alias, nickname, or URI that contextualizes
      the identity. May represent a simple handle (e.g., "rick") or
      a link to a digital or immersive environment.
      In future versions, this field may be cryptographically linked
      to a namespace registry for verified ownership.

  - name: created_at
    type: timestamp
    required: true
    description: >
      Timestamp of initial identity creation or binding.

  - name: updated_at
    type: timestamp
    required: false
    description: >
      Timestamp of last update to this identity record.

  - name: active
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: >
      Whether this identity is currently active in the domain.

  cryptographic_upgrade_note: >
      Future versions (v0.2+) may add a foreign key to a `namespaces` table
      and a signature field to prove ownership of namespace strings.

examples:
  - dis_uid: "dis_uid:terra:rick:bf72a8c19f"
    namespace: "rick"
    created_at: "2025-10-11T18:22:00Z"
    active: true
