  title: "Seat of Authority Schema"
  description: >
    A Seat is a locus of legitimate authority within a domain. It represents
    the structural capacity through which sovereignty becomes actionable.
    Seats may also engage with shadow or phantom domains through verified
    oversight bindings that preserve accountability and limit influence.

  fields:
    domain: string
    purpose: string
    occupant_id: string
    consent_ref: string
    delegation_ref: string
    mode: [inactive, active, delegated]
    status: [vacant, occupied, suspended, dissolved]
    term_duration: string
    lineage_ref: string
    policy_scope: [string]
    ethics_ref: string
    audit_interval: string
    legitimacy_status: [verified, shadow, phantom]     # harmonized term
    phantom_binding_ref: string                        # replaces ghost_binding_ref

    eligibility_criteria:

        requirement_type: [qualification, lineage, consent]
    commentary: >
      Declares how the Seatâ€™s authority is lawfully established.  Each method
      must produce verifiable receipts and be auditable through lineage.

  delegator_policy:
    mode: [dormant, delegative, procedural]
    delegate_ref: string
    conditions:
      - trigger: string
        action: string
        target: string
    commentary: >
      Defines behavior when unoccupied.  Delegation never bypasses lineage
      or consent verification.

  commentary: >
    Seats define where and how authority is instantiated inside DIS.
    They maintain continuity
