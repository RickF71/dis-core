# DOMAIN.SEAT v1.0 — Seat of Authority Schema

    Canonical definition of a Seat of Authority within DIS.
    A Seat represents the actionable node of consent, legitimacy,
    and power within a domain. All domain actions must ultimately
    be traceable through one or more Seats to a verified consent.

# 1. SEAT STRUCTURE
# ============================================================

seat:
  id: string
  version: v1
  layer: DIS
  title: "Seat of Authority Schema"
  description: >
    A Seat is a locus of legitimate authority within a domain. It represents
    the structural capacity through which sovereignty becomes actionable.
    Seats may also engage with shadow or phantom domains through verified
    oversight bindings that preserve accountability and limit influence.

    commentary: >
      Declares how the Seat’s authority is lawfully established. Each method
      must produce verifiable receipts and be auditable through lineage.

# 3. DELEGATION & BEHAVIOR

    mode: [dormant, delegative, procedural]

    conditions:
      - trigger: string
        action: string
        target: string
    commentary: >
      Defines behavior when unoccupied. Delegation never bypasses lineage
      or consent verification.
