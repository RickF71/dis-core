version: v0.1
about: "DIS-CORE Consent and Moral Legitimacy ruleset (v0.8.7)."

gate_rules:
  - id: personal_autonomy
    threshold: 0.80
    description: >
      Individual autonomy is primary. When actions affect individuals,
      explicit consent must be present and legitimacy must meet threshold.

  - id: reciprocal_transparency
    threshold: 0.60
    description: >
      Legitimacy improves when all affected parties are informed (reciprocal visibility).

  - id: trust_decay
    threshold: -1
    description: >
      Dynamic: repeated low-legitimacy or throttled actions accelerate trust decay
      (implemented by feedback loop, not at gate time).

  - id: moral_feedback
    threshold: 0.50
    description: >
      Gate will emit deltas to be processed by the moral feedback loop (trust/ethics/legitimacy updates).

weights:
  trust_increase: 0.05
  trust_decrease: -0.10
  ethics_bonus: 0.03
  ethics_penalty: -0.07

throttle:
  enabled: true
  low_trust_floor: 0.30
  backoff_ms: 15000

notes:
  - "Thresholds are conservative defaults; tune per domain culture."
  - "Trust deltas should be bounded globally to prevent runaway dynamics."
  - "Receipts carry ConsentVersion for audit parity across upgrades."
