title: Self-Supported Domains
status: proposed
description: |
  Defines the structure and purpose of self-supported or spiritual domains that
  exist within larger civic domains. These subdomains maintain moral and
  psychological equilibrium, reducing the need for external regulation.

definition:
  type: object
  properties:
    name: { type: string, description: "Domain identifier (e.g. domain.greenpeace)" }
    parent_domain: { type: string, description: "Parent civic or governmental domain" }
