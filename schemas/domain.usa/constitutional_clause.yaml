  Establishes the correspondence between the United States' founding ideals
  and the DIS universal model of Terra, Lima, and Numen.

text: |
  We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all persons possess the right
  to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness, understood within DIS as the
  right to physical integrity (Terra), moral agency (Lima), and the free
  expression of will (Numen â†’ Terra through Lima).

  These rights are not conferred by any authority, but recognized as inherent
  properties of consciousness. The role of `domain.usa` is to preserve and
  harmonize these properties within its civic field, ensuring that Life is
  protected, Liberty is cultivated, and the Pursuit of Happiness remains
  unobstructed.
