description: >
  Defines the axiom that all creation arises from mutual recognition
  between distinct awareness entities (Lima↔Lima or Lima↔Numen).

principles:
  - generativity_requires: "mutual recognition and consent"
  - biological_pairing: "example of Terra-level generativity"
  - intellectual_creation: "Lima-Numen equivalence in principle"
  - coercion_or_exploitation: "nullifies generativity"
  - empathy_feedback: "amplifies coherence and sustainability"

notes:
  - "Life and meaning share one pattern: generation through mutuality."
