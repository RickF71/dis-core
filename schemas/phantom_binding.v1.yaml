  layer: DIS
  title: "Phantom Power Containment Schema"
  description: >
    Defines the containment and conditional validation of a phantom (unverified)
    power structure—corporate, governmental, or AI—within DIS.  Enables
    limited interoperability through oversight seats without granting
    full legitimacy.  A Phantom Binding establishes verifiable boundaries,
    audit schedules, and expiry for unverified entities operating within
    or alongside DIS.

  fields:
    phantom_domain_ref: string           # External or NODIS domain being bound.
    oversight_seat_ref: string           # DIS seat responsible for containment.
    verification_level: [symbolic, partial, full]
    verified_scope: [string]             # Declared, limited areas of interaction.
    audit_cycle: string                  # Required audit frequency (e.g., annual).
    expiry: datetime                     # Expiration of authorization window.
    renewal_policy:
      allowed: boolean
      requires_audit: boolean
    legitimacy_status: [phantom, shadow]
    sealed_content_hash: string          # Optional hash for sealed agreements.
    receipts:
      - phantom.boundary.receipt.v1
      - phantom.scope.receipt.v1
    commentary: >
      Phantom bindings permit mapping and containment of power that operates
      outside verifiable consent lineage.  They formalize its existence without
      endorsing its legitimacy.  Oversight seats define boundaries, frequency
      of review, and expiry, ensuring unverified power cannot persist unbounded.
