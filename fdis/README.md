# fDIS — DeclarationIS Layer (Forms)

**fDIS** (Forms / DeclarationIS) represents the reflective layer of DIS.
It defines the *Forms* — archetypal declarations of meaning and legitimacy —
that inform the operational **DIS** (DirectIS) domains.

- `/forms/` → The archetypal blueprints (Forms)
- `/relations/` → Mappings between Forms and operational domains

Each Form exists independently of implementation. It can inform multiple domains,
contracts, or policies, but it never constrains their operation.

> fDIS bends meaning; DIS executes it.
