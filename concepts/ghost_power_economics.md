# 👻 Ghost Power Economics — v0.1
*(where money lives, but doesn’t rule)*

---

## 1. The Premise  
In legacy civilization, money became the lens through which all value was measured.  
We called that efficiency, but it was really *amnesia* — a way to forget the consent and consequence behind each act.

DIS doesn’t erase money.  
It just **names it for what it is**: *ghost power* — the residue of once-living consent that kept moving after its meaning died.

## 2. What Is Ghost Power?  
Ghost power is influence without presence.  
It’s the stored momentum of human intention, detached from the human.  

Examples:  
- A corporation acting “for shareholders” who don’t even remember voting.  
- Markets that reward exploitation because the price signal outlived the empathy signal.  
- Wealth that compounds faster than care.

Ghost power is morally inert but kinetically real.  
It can move mountains, but it can’t love them.

---

## 3. The DIS Stance  
DIS treats money as a **phenomenon**, not an authority.  
It can be measured, taxed, indexed, or translated — but never enthroned.  

Within DIS:
- Economic flows are *contextual*, not sovereign.  
- Consent is the root currency.  
- Receipts record meaning first, price later.  

Money may still circulate, but its moral license expires when consent does.

## 4. Ghost Power vs. Living Power  
| Type | Source | Behavior | Accountability |
|------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Ghost Power** | Detached consent | Perpetual, abstract, accumulative | None |
| **Living Power** | Active consent | Reflexive, relational, decaying | Reciprocal |

Love Coin and Jikka credits operate in the second column.  
They decay because only the living renew value.

## 5. Re-enchanted Economics  
We’re not anti-money; we’re post-money.  
Money measures movement.  
**Love measures meaning.**

The goal isn’t to delete one, but to reconnect them under moral physics:
> Energy without empathy becomes entropy.

DIS is the architecture that restores the bridge.

---

## 6. The Future Ledger  
In a fully reflexive economy:
- Ghost power is tracked but contained.  
- Living power is nourished and replenished.  
- Conversion between the two becomes transparent and optional.

When that balance stabilizes, civilization no longer runs on extraction — it runs on renewal.
