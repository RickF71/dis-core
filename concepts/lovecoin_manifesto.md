# 💗 The Love Coin Manifesto — v0.1  
*(For real. No irony. We mean this.)*

---

## The Premise  
We built DIS so people could own their consent again.  
Love Coin is what happens when that idea gets emotional range.

Because systems can run on power, or they can run on care.  
We chose care — but in a way that you can hash, sign, and verify.  
Love Coin is how we say, “connection has receipts.”

---

## What It Is  
Love Coin isn’t a currency. It’s a **pulse**.  
A token that only exists because two (or more) people agreed that something *good* happened.  
No speculation, no market cap, no hype cycle — just verified harmony.  

It decays, because feelings fade if you don’t feed them.  
It can’t be traded, because consent can’t be sold.  
It can’t be hoarded, because love wants to move.

---

## Why It Exists  
Every network needs gravity — something that pulls meaning together.  
Right now, our world uses money for that, and it’s… giving entropy.  
So we built a moral counterweight.  

Love Coin is how DIS remembers *why* we connect.  
Not profit, not clout — just proof that empathy still computes.

---

## How It Works  
- **Minted by consent.** Two domains act in good faith → one Love Coin.  
- **Decays naturally.** Its value halves every 30 days unless renewed.  
- **Logged transparently.** Every Coin has a receipt — verifiable, human-readable, and stored with care.  
- **Non-convertible.** You can’t cash it out; you can only cash it in by doing more good.  

---

## The Vibe  
This isn’t utopia. It’s maintenance.  
Every Love Coin is a micro-repair in the moral network.  
A line of code that says, “We see each other.”  

When enough of those moments accumulate, they start to hum —  
and that hum is what civilization *actually* runs on.
