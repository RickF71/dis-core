# Virtual USGOV Governance Charter (v0.9.2)

## Purpose
The **Virtual USGOV** domain (`domain.virtual.usa`) exists as a *parallel consent substrate* to the real United States Government.  
Its purpose is to provide a lawful, transparent, and voluntary digital space for governance, identity, and representation—mirroring real systems but operating purely through **consensual verification**.

## Principles
1. **Non-Coercion** — No citizen of domain.virtual.usa can be compelled to act without explicit consent.
2. **Transparency** — All ledgers, receipts, and consent events are publicly auditable.
3. **Parallel Legitimacy** — The virtual domain mirrors the RL USGOV structure (executive, legislative, judicial) for simulation and integration testing.
4. **Interoperability** — Credentials can bridge to personal DIS identities, corporate domains, or Simula environments.
5. **Ephemeral Consent** — Scope-0 interactions support "just this once" decisions with no persistent tracking.
6. **Preventing Nanny-State Drift** — All actions must be user-initiated; surveillance, prediction, or auto-enforcement are forbidden without Jikka-mediated trust.
7. **Human Anchoring** — Every virtual law or act must trace back to at least one verified human consent event.

## Implementation Roadmap (Phase-0: Simula)
- Implement sandbox version within **domain.simula-terra**.
- Use **dis-auth-handshake.v0** for all authentication flows.
- Create `virtual_usa.credential.v0` as the base citizen credential.
- Map consent flows from simulated to real user DIS instances.
- Integrate with Console authentication for unified experience.

(opinion) → This creates a *mirror republic* that is non-destructive and testable — a digital constitution that evolves in open daylight.
